## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


I have an inline @ficetola2015replication citation and a bracketed citation [@ficetola2015replication]









```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


 - item 1
 - item 2
 - item 3
    + item 3a
    + item 3b
    

1. item1
2. item 2
    + item 2a
        + test



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
#R commands here
head(cars)

```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##__Table 1__

col 1 | col 2 | col 3
--- | --- | ---
row1 | 1 | 2
row 2 | 3 | *4*

```{r}
head(cars)
```

##Stuff including kableTable

```{r Heading/kableTable}

data.frame(col1=rnorm(20), col2=rnorm(20)) %>%
  mutate(col1=sprintf('%.3f',col1)) %>% #sprint f will return a character, the % means substitue in the first argument coming in (col1), the dot indicates the decimal, then we want three figures after the decimal, the f indicates the object coming in is a decimal number. So this function will take everything to three zeros, then pipe it through the end of the table with %>%
  #Make sure to do this as the last thing before it hits the formatting table
  kable(., 
        digits=2, 
        col.names=c("Column 1",  "Column 2"),
        align = "lr",
        caption = "My caption", 
        format="html") %>% 
  group_rows("first5",1,5) %>%
  group_rows('second5',6,10)%>%
  add_header_above(c("Group 1" = 2)) 

#=1 is how wide it's going to be, check online on how to do kable tables
