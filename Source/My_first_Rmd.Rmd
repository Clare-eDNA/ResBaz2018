## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


 - item 1
 - item 2
 - item 3
    + item 3a
    + item 3b
    

1. item1
2. item 2
    + item 2a
        + test



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
#R commands here
head(cars)

```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
